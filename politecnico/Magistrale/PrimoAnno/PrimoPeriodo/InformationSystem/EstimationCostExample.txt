2 boundary
eg: in the estimation if i buy a library i should not consider that function anymore in the computation of the LOC's.Very important to nkow what is
in and what is out because what is out should not count in the effort.
3 components data
there is a perect match between this and a class in a class diagram.
FTR = number of classes touched by the function

first you list the classes,then you define the functions that should be inside and basing on the numbers of attributes touched you give a weight.
