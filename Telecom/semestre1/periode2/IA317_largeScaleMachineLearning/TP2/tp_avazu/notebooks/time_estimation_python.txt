## Piece of code to estimate the time of execution in python


## If you want to estimate the time of a block on one run
from time import time
start = time()
np.ones(10000) * 2
np.ones(10000) * 2
print(time() - start)

## If you want to estimate the time of a block one several runs to have a better estimation
## At the beginning of the CELL add
%%timeit

## If you want to estimate the time of a line one several runs to have a better estimation
## At the beginning of the LINE add
%timeit
