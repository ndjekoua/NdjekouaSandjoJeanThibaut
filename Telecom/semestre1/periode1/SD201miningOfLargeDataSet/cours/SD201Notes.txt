*******DECESON TREES VALIDATION*************
When performing a holdout(2/3 for training and 1/3 for testing) even if the  qccirqcy  is not good, it's bad idea to
modify some parameters in trying to make it perfeoms well on test test because that may lead to OVERFITTING on test set.

******IMPLEMENT THE A PRIORI ALGORITHM USING SPARK************

******PCY improvmment of  A priori*****

we introduce a bucket. and the hash function for example is f(i,j) = (i+j)%3
(1,2)
(3,6)
(3,1)
(5,1)
(5)

1) we compute the support of each item(pass 1)
1->3 ,2->1 ect ..

buckets : b0 = 3((1+2)mod3=0 ect..) ,b1=1 ,b2=0

so at pass 2
we will have only (5,1)because 5 and 1 are 1-frequent and the bucket associated to them is also frequent.
while for (3,1) 3 and 1 are fequent but the bcuket ASSOCIATED TO THEM  is not frequent.
